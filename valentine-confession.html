                        &emsp; Happy Birthday to the most incredible soul I’ve ever had the blessing to know! Our journey of 14 years together has been nothing short of magical — from carefree childhood memories to the rollercoasters of growing up, you've always been my constant. In a world where people often come and go, your presence in my life has been a rare gift. You stood by me when I had nothing but shadows around me, lifting me up with your unshakable support and love. While others misunderstood me and saw flaws, you looked deeper and saw the real me — and for that, I’m endlessly grateful. 
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  You are not just my best friend, you’re my safe place, my strength, and my biggest blessing. Words fall short to express how much you mean to me. I’d go to the ends of the world for you, without a second thought. You’ve filled my life with warmth, understanding, and loyalty that few ever get to experience. I like you so much more than these words can say, and I hope this year brings you all the joy, love, and happiness you deserve. Happy Birthday, Mathi — here’s to forever, because our bond is truly unbreakable.
